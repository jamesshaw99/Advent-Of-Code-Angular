# Advent of Code Challenges - Angular Project

This repository contains an Angular project where I solve the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges. The project is structured to solve each day's challenge from various years using Angular, providing a clean and organized solution for each puzzle.

## Overview

Advent of Code is an annual event where a programming puzzle is released every day in December. This repository contains Angular code to solve these puzzles, with each year and day organized in separate modules.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate my problem-solving skills and proficiency in Angular development, while also making use of TypeScript and other modern web technologies.

I have also made use of the Karma Jasmine testing framework to unit test as i go.

## Original repo

I started doing Advent of Code during lockdown, with my [original solutions](https://github.com/jamesshaw99/Advent-of-Code) completed in Java. As my day job is developing web apps, i decided that I would make use of my knowledge of angular for future advent of code events, with the plan to port my old java solutions into typescript
